## The Competition
[BunnyBots](http://team1540.org/bunnybots/) is an annual competition for FRC teams hosted by [the Flaming Chickens](http://team1540.org/), at [Catlin Gabel](http://www.catlin.edu/). The 12-week build season starts in September, and lasts until December. Like [FRC](http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc), the game changes every year.

## 2016 Game
The 2016 game, "Round-a-BOUT", was announced September 1st. In it, six robots, three per alliance, drive around a figure-eight track while shooting darts at each other, and loading stuffed bunnies into recycle bins.

## What we're up to
We are very busy coming up with ideas for this year's BunnyBot. We'll share more in a few weeks!
