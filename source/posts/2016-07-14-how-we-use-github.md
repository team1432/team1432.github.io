## About [GitHub](https://github.com)
[GitHub](https://github.com) is free hosting for projects using [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Git is a source code manager which lets you go through the history of your project, and if you ever make a mistake, you can `diff` between two versions of files and see what changed.

GitHub is free for [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) projects, which is how we use it.
