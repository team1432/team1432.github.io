## About [GitHub](https://github.com)

[GitHub](https://github.com) is free hosting for projects using [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Git is a source code manager which lets you go through the history of your project, and if you ever make a mistake, you can `diff` between two versions of files and see exactly what changed. It also lets multiple people collaborate on one project without overwriting each other's changes.

GitHub is free for [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) projects, which is how we use it.

## Open Source
[Anyone can view our robot code online](https://github.com/team1432/FRC-2016), even without an account. We chose open source because we want people to be able to contribute to and learn from our code.

## Branches
In Git, branches are copies of the code, each with some changes from the `master` branch. Branches are often created for new features, and once the feature is complete, the feature branch is merged with the `master` branch. Although we haven't used branches for the 2016 robot code, we hope to use them more next year because it reduces the likelihood of something breaking. Branches are very useful with larger groups, because that way people can be working on different features without messing up each other's code.
