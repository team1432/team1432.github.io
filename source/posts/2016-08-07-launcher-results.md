## What launcher?

We built a launcher this summer to shoot 6" balls. We wanted to see how much compression, angle, and speed is ideal to shoot balls different distatnces.

## Results

This is what we found:

| farthest distance | angle | lower speed | upper speed |
| ----------------- | ----- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1                 | 2     | 3           | 4           |
