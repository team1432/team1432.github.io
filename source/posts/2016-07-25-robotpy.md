## RobotPy?

[RobotPy](https://robotpy.github.io/) lets FRC teams use Python for their robot code.

## Why?
Previously, we had been using Java, but I prefer Python, so we decided try it out. RobotPy is supported by the FRC community, and it is very actively maintained. Its [documentation](http://robotpy.readthedocs.io/) is very good, and is more detailed than the [wpilib java documentation](http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/).

## wpilib?

Wpilib is the programming framework for FRC teams, for Java, C++, and LabView. It makes it easy for teams to implement motors, joysticks, sensors, and much more. RobotPy has [an implementation of wpilib](http://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wpilib.html), almost identical to the official Java version, only for Python.

## Problems
Although switching to Python is appealing
