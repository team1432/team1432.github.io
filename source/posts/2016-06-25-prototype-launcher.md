We have been working on a prototype launcher to test how changing the speed of upper and lower launcher wheels affects the launch angle of the ball

Ideally, the change in launch wheel speed will change the ball angle enough so that we don't have to rotate the launcher mechanism vertically to change the launch angle significantly. By not needing a mechanism to rotate the shooter vertically, we can save space on future robots.

This is our first project we designed using [Autodesk Inventor](http://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview). In the future, we hope to model all of our robots in CAD.
