What we are working on over the next week

In the next few weeks, we plan to build a prototype launcher to test how changing the speed of upper and lower launcher wheels affects the launch angle of the ball:

Ideally, the change in launch wheel speed will change the ball angle enough so that we don't have to rotate the launcher mechanism vertically to change the launch angle significantly. By not needing a mechanism to rotate the shooter, we can save space on the robot.

This will be our first project we will CAD with [Autodesk Inventor](http://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview). In the future, we hope to CAD all of our robot designs.

After this prototype, we hope to build a robot with a rotating turret.
