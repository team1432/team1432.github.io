## 2004
In 2004 the team was started my Mr. Mahr, Franklin High School's metal shop instructor and Katy. That year's game was FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar. At that time the game rules were quite different than today. Robots could weigh up to 300 pounds instead of today's 120 pounds, and they didn't have bumpers. Teams could score by having their human player score purple balls in any of the goals, capping the goals with a multiplier ball, or hanging their robot suspended from the 10-foot (3.0 m) high 'chin up bar.' James McCabe designed the T-shirt from that year. The beaver's name is Chunky Downawell.

## 2005
In 2005, the game was called 'Triple Play.' Teams had to score 'tetras' on nine goals. We used the same T-shirt as the year before. We had about seven people on the team.

## 2007
Rack 'n Roll was 2007's game. Robots had to hang inflatable pool toys on an octagonal rack in the middle of the field. The pool toys could be arranged like in Tic-Tac-Toe to get additional points.

# 2008
In 2008, robots had to push 40" balls around an oval track. The game was called Overdrive.

# 2009
2009's game was called Lunacy. The field was covered in a smooth surface called 'Regolith,' and robots were required to have low-traction wheels, which led to robots not being very capable of slowing down and speeding up. Robots had to score in baskets attatched to other robots.

# 2010
In 2010, the game, Breakaway, was based on soccer. Robots drove across large bumps in the middle of the field, and shot soccer balls into goals.

# 2011
