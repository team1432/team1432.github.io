If you ever wondered why picking up a tote from the ground was important.  The video shows equipment used for picking up bales off the ground and stacking them.  Like the FRC robots there are hundreds of style's of this farm equipment and many of the issues face by the robotics groups are faced by the engineers creating these designs.  As a quick example the rules in the game are that you cannot damage game equipment, if the bale stacker in the video damaged every 3rd bale the farmer would demand his money back.  The skills learned in building a robot will last a lifetime.
